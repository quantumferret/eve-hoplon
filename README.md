# eveauth
A discord bot that will authenticate new members joining an Eve corporation's discord server through the EVE SSO authentication flow.

Very much a work in progress at this point.

This project is largely for fun and to improve at various aspects of (web) programming, but it could have some utility to Eve corporations if/when finished and properly deployed - there is a dearth of lightweight options for EVE authentication integrated with discord server role management for end-users who don't want to have to get their hands dirty beyond adding a discord bot to a server.
